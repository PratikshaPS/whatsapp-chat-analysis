In binary classification we have a classification report where we have 2 classes - 0 and 1.
In that case shall we focus on precision/recall of class 0 or class 1.
22/02/2022, 5:08 am - +91 90803 38368: It is based on your problem statement
22/02/2022, 9:43 am - +91 78755 53730: Hi all! ,

22/02/2022, 9:49 am - +91 6358 070 852: Even in high accuracy it will give prediction
But by checking precision and recall and fbeta score, you can see, how correct your prediction is.

08/03/2022, 7:39 pm - +91 98841 29630: Dear friends ,

I need someone's help for finding a range of values using python .

Condition is :
1.  range of values should be between 0 to 120 ( number can be repeated). 

2. Total no of rows is 393. 

3. Average must be 58. 

So we have  an average and length of rows values. We need to find the range of it. 

Ex: (range 0-120)/393 = 58

Can someone help me how to figure out those range using python ?

12/03/2022, 12:16 pm - +91 93198 39861: Do we have any course or videos related to deep learning model optimization?
Couldn't find anything related to OpenVINO .
12/03/2022, 12:58 pm - +91 6386 461 149: Three type of optimization you can prefer

1. Knowledge Distillation: Student-Teacher Learning making use of KL Divergence to compare two models.

Majorly models like Transformer goes through this process as they are having a lot of parameters that why you can see, distillery, DistillRoberta in Hugging face.

2. Model Quantization: FP16, FP32, FP64 previously we have apex module by nvidia but now you can easily find this implementation in pytorch trainer

3. Model Pruning: Removing the weighted connection in model, to reduce its size majorly prefers for edge devices.
12/03/2022, 1:00 pm - +91 6386 461 149: The above are major one which are generally preferred depending upon the use case and size of the model, and the disadvantage is you will see a reduction in predection, your model might not be that good after size reduction and optimization but inference time will reduce.
12/03/2022, 1:00 pm - +91 6386 461 149: *distillBERT
12/03/2022, 1:01 pm - +91 6386 461 149: You can also convert you model to ONNX graph this also help you to achive some optimization

12/03/2022, 4:05 pm - +1 (672) 999-3979: I need a suggestion for a Classification project for a Pet insurance dataset where task is to classify whether claim has been made for wrong pet (label 0) or right pet (label 1) for a given Pet owner (because one Pet owner could have more than 2 pets which result is wrong classification of claims)  Given dataset as follows:                                      PolicyId 	OwnerId 	ClaimId 	LineItemId 	ClaimDate 	PolicyPetName  ItemDescription 	          WrongPetFlag
0 	          0           0                0                    5/3/2018 	         Justice 	           Justice: Cytopoint         	0.0                       I  want to build classification model with XGB Classifier/Random boost. Could anyone please give insight how Pet name (very imp feature) could be used in this case as XGB classifier only takes numerical values. I am not sure whether encoding techinques will work here properly. Please provide your valuable advice ASAP. If anyone solve similar case please let me know. Thanks a lot
12/03/2022, 4:21 pm - +1 (672) 999-3979: I am thinking of another approach of BERT classifier model using text column in dataset but not sure. Please suggest as this a part of interview question.
12/03/2022, 8:25 pm - +91 78755 53730: Hi All....I have a question regarding the re-training approach....say suppose I have Albert model Trained on a Dataset and deployed now after a certain period model degrades because the type of Data which now I'm getting is a bit different from the original Training Data. Now for the Re-Training, we will use Orginal + New Data or only the New Data for the Re-Training.
12/03/2022, 8:26 pm - +46 73 871 91 17: Original + new data

12/03/2022, 8:57 pm - +91 77240 83836: I have the API key
12/03/2022, 9:02 pm - +91 78755 53730: correct me if the understanding is right or not....if the business context is different better to go for different models training and if the business context is the same merge the data and retrain it...?

At present we want to build a model training pipeline where it detects degradation......and do re-training....type of data can be found for example news it can have a section of like politics, economics sports etc. So Data will be huge...want to take right approach.

Q1 - Design the data structure with the following properties:
The data structure is either callable or indexable. It will accepts a single parameter, as integer, and return the parsed contents of the row corresponding to the given index.
The data structure needs to return the number of rows in the file (and in memory) when called with the python command len(my_data_struct)

To understand this question
14/03/2022, 10:47 am - +91 6386 461 149: You can make use of new data and try to make it pretty much similar to original one because if you want that your pipeline should be automatmated then you should reduce the time in manual process which I see is very less in for NLP Models because we only have text preprocessing steps then tokenization.

So New Data will work well for retraining and adding original data doesn't make too much effect of performance as you're retraining the same model

14/03/2022, 12:39 pm - +91 93246 18046: Dear all,
I need guidance regarding this.
I am new to data science.
Case 1 : Currently i am working as machine learning engineer in org named maximus. Maximus mostly works on ..Net and data science is totally new there. We are only 2 people in that also my couligue left. But thanks to Ineuron course, i am able to build a model. Yes, I an learning but no one to guide and to evaluate me. Enjoying but also in confusion.

Case 2: I have job offer as data scientists at G-Square solutions which is purely AI-ML driven org. Yes, its like startup but i did research on them and their work looks interesting. Guidance will be proper, will get chance to work with data science professionals.

Package wise not much difference.

How should i think over it??

For Grammer correction you can again Downstream BERT, RoBerta for this task, now as in grammer correction we need to look various grammatical factors so you need to customise it accordingly refer to below blog: https://medium.com/beyond-webspellchecker/multi-headed-model-based-on-bert-to-solve-grammatical-error-correction-tasks-more-efficiently-94615e3f53e6

21/03/2022, 12:23 pm - +91 70383 38674: Hello all, I have a dictionary where key is abbreviations and value is their expansion.
I wanted to create a NLP Model, which is able to find and replace expansion of abbreviations when it comes in a given sentence.
ex:
input: I don't like this bskt.
output: i do not like this basket.

input: pls take this wtrbtl.
output: please take this water bottle.

Please give some ideas or suggestions to solve.

Thank You,
Rushikesh

21/03/2022, 1:40 pm - +91 78755 53730: I am Building Natural Language Inference model where we will infer claim and evidence. After training to build this end-to-end product, the user will enter a claim and the system has to convert the claim into a question and search google to find Evidence. And whatever evidence we found on that we do NLI. My query does we have an API for google where we query and we get evidence. At the moment this is prototyping so we want a free license one, later once the full product is developed licensing can be taken later for the API.

I need help for a usecase to train on image plus tabular data for classify
23/03/2022, 11:30 am - +91 90039 68712: Try wide and deep model.
23/03/2022, 11:30 am - +91 96201 06750: I have image data to classify by mvcnn, additional I'll get tabular data features of image to classify better
23/03/2022, 11:31 am - +91 90039 68712: Yes this will work. Try search in google. Wide and deep model architecture.
23/03/2022, 11:32 am - +91 96201 06750: Thanks Mahi I'll look into
23/03/2022, 11:37 am - +91 6386 461 149: Create two heads in the first one make use of any image classification model which can extract image embeddings and classify the images the second head will the one in which you can feed the metadata/tabualar data and get the prediction by taking any classification model, at the end avarage the prediction from both the heads.

Swin Transformer + SVC Head I have used it in one kaggle competition.

Then what approaches can we use to reduce the dimension without transforming them. Basically what sort of technique should we use for selecting important features ? Will only forward selection or backward selection be sufficient ?

Actually I have created one project of computer vision with flask app as well but unable to deploy in cloud 
because  when I am trying to save the model using model.save() the size of model around 360 mb so unable to deploy this in GitHub (exceed in size).
please help me to find alternative to deploy model in cloud or reduce the size model
23/03/2022, 7:04 pm - +91 93047 23057: Choose some light weight model

24/03/2022, 7:15 pm - +91 78755 53730: @916386461149 I’m trying to do re-training on new dataset in same domain. Did fine tune for 4 epochs first two gave me good results but next two gave me very bad evaluation F1 score. What do you suggest more training epochs or something else …
24/03/2022, 7:36 pm - +91 80958 17985: Has anyone used SynapseML from Microsoft?
24/03/2022, 7:51 pm - +91 6386 461 149: Try to track the experiments in weight and biases, make use of scheduler and train for larger epochs see 10-20 for intial test and check validation loss
24/03/2022, 7:58 pm - +91 78755 53730: Okay then let me try train again for 10 epochs. 

One last question I initially trained with old dataset for 10 epochs which gave f1 score of 0.88 then after getting new data set in same domain. I again started fine tuning for 10th epochs i.e. resuming from 10 epochs to 14 epochs. 

Correct me if I’m wrong you asking me to train from 10 to 20 epochs or you are trying to say load the train weights and re train for 10 to 20 epochs.

25/03/2022, 9:55 am - +91 93703 59448: How data scientist can help Tyre company like mrf or Michelin . All your ideas are important
25/03/2022, 10:26 am - +91 95662 06221: Hi how to continuously keep evaluating model performance, how to continuously keep tagging for new data when model performance degrades
25/03/2022, 10:32 am - +91 6358 070 852: Maybe you can use it for checking the sales, and how you can improve it, what customers like or dislike.
Where the sales is low, why?
25/03/2022, 10:58 am - +91 77388 62243: There are many applications, it depends on client requirements whether they want to improve their manufacturing quality, functional characteristics, reduce visual inspection, warranty analysis or customer satisfaction! Based on these requirements there are many possibilities of DS based projects covering regression, classification, computer vision and NLP techniques!😃
25/03/2022, 11:00 am - +91 98090 37072: You may look into the percentage of population who are using public transport  and how it impacts  recurring sales of tyres. Even consider governments upcoming projects on public infra developments like bullet trains etc and do predictions based on assessments (like no. of people who may switch to these new services) published by government.
25/03/2022, 12:40 pm - +91 96201 06750: Sudhanshu sir oceans of ideas to help everyone. Your main focus is help eachother grow eachother.

26/03/2022, 7:14 am - +91 93047 23057: I know, my one of friend recently interviewed and joined there ..
26/03/2022, 7:41 am - +91 98745 88202: I recently took the test, and this is what one of the current employee advised:

The test will most probably contain 6-7 MCQs on Stat and DS fundamentals like Hypothesis testing and all.
2 Python competitive coding questions of 10-12 lines of problem statement, sample input, sample output and 10-15 hidden testcases.

You should try getting all the MCQs right at any cost and then pass at least few hidden testcases of atleast one code, if not all.
Passing 4-5 testcases of 1 of the codes and correct MCQs will be sufficient to qualify most of the times.
Coding questions are really difficult sometimes.

All the best!
26/03/2022, 7:42 am - +1 (672) 999-3979: Great, please share the experience

All of you made a transition to different data careers. I wanted to know how long you plan to stay in present company before going for next switch?

I made transition to data science at EXL, joined in Sept and completed 7 months here. Have a decent salary but can see people with my exp (4yrs) getting much more in industry.
26/03/2022, 11:29 am - +91 96544 18334: Can you suggest what are your plans and if I should start preparing to make another switch
26/03/2022, 11:30 am - +91 93703 59448: 1 year
26/03/2022, 11:32 am - +91 93198 39861: I think one year is good after that you can start looking for a switch.
Goto LinkedIn see the job description and start preparing.
26/03/2022, 11:56 am - +91 76760 31474: Min 1 and half will be good.

1st round:
 
Online test on:
Python coding
SQL coding

2nd round:

1.	You have 30records with 10 features. You made 10 trees(n_estimators).Data is divided into 80/20 ratio(train/test set). After one epoch, Training accuracy you got 80% but test 	accuracy you got 60 %. Now what would you do to handle this.
2.	In share trading, a buyer buys shares and sells on a future date. Given the stock price of n days, the trader is allowed to make at most k transactions, where a new transaction can only start after the previous transaction is complete, find out the maximum profit that a share trader could have made.
3.	you have 25 cards of 5 different colour. what is the probability if picking 2 different color cards.
4.	Probability of - atleast 1 plane goes away every 5 min  = 15%. What is the probability of atleast 1 plane go every 30 minute?
5.	What is the probability that a point will lie close to circumference of the circle than to center.
6.	There is one categorical feature which is having 3 catergories.How do you deal with this?(then folow up question when I told about dummies) How do you get the dummies? How the metrics gets affected.

3rd round(DS final round):

1.	Find the largest cumulative sum from a list having -ve and +integers.
2.	How to draw AUC graph?
3.	Case Study - You work in Hyundai(car manufacture company). The company is giving 20% discount(in terms of low interest loan rate, etc). How this will impact on sales?(Give the approach and approx sales figure by assuming some sales figure pre-discount)
4.	Resume discussion

4th Round(MLOps final round):
26/03/2022, 1:07 pm - +91 80958 17985: These are the questions I have been asked when I got interviewed.

Hope this helps .

26/03/2022, 1:09 pm - +91 80958 17985: No problem
26/03/2022, 1:34 pm - +91 96202 15123: 🤔
26/03/2022, 1:36 pm - +91 90206 29210: Hi, I got interviewed into a project requirement and since its a transition most of my experience projects are POC. Interviewer dived deep into each and every aspect on project and also asked design patterns and micro service architectures. Finally he said that he cannot directly put me into core data science since my most of project  havent handled that much big data and my pipelines are not production grade. in their project  1 day generated data is more than 7 billion from a server and  have to handle multisources. 

so he suggested to work with ELK stack, get hands on to data, familiarize, explore, visualize, create data pipelines and gradually based on learning and performance they can move into core data science or ML. 

I got confused since I am not familiar with ELK and data engg. Is this the correct way of moving into data science area or would I stuck into ELK stack forever?

How to do annotations on resume text for custom NER using transform. Transforms requires special format other than spacy.

Like sentences id, tag B-PER, etc.

02/04/2022, 2:37 pm - +1 (672) 999-3979: Hi Folks,
I need your suggestions for an interview problem.
I have given an unannotated customer chat data with agent of finance company. The task is to use this data to provide business insights and actionable recommendations (within 1 day time limit). 
The main data columns are:
Utterance                author role
a) Hi, how are you       agent
b) I m good                    customer
As no specific questions are asked, how to approach this problem. 
1)	Should I annotate text data and is it possible to annotate in this time limit, or
2)	Is there some NLP techniques which could be performed without annotating this data? 
Anyone working here in similar domain, please suggest.
Thanks a lot
02/04/2022, 6:04 pm - +91 99750 97646: Use topic modeling and based on topics you can use clustering for customer segmentation
02/04/2022, 6:06 pm - +91 93703 59448: Use topic modeling with LDA and then dbscan
02/04/2022, 6:09 pm - +91 93703 59448: You can visualize it by geo, topic, keywords inside that topic,time series for topic with sentiment analysis

04/04/2022, 12:57 am - +91 95662 06221: I have a sample where 95% is one class remaining is other classes
04/04/2022, 12:58 am - +91 95662 06221: How to handle this
04/04/2022, 1:32 am - +91 6386 461 149: It is highly imbalanced try to fix it, because I dont think anything will work fine here
04/04/2022, 2:00 am - +91 79872 90377: You can use ensemble techniques and hyper parameters tunning and you can also try up and down sampling
04/04/2022, 7:08 am - +91 80958 17985: Or you can set the class weights for the two classes.

05/04/2022, 2:24 pm - +91 78755 53730: are you using Transformer..?
05/04/2022, 2:25 pm - +91 90039 68712: Not yet finalized. We do have two models, CNN and distilbert.
05/04/2022, 2:25 pm - +49 171 2317046: feedback loop as in active learning?
05/04/2022, 2:26 pm - +91 90039 68712: Yes. I am mainly looking for active learning or incremental learning.
05/04/2022, 2:27 pm - +91 78755 53730: so you may have to use custom Training Loop
05/04/2022, 2:27 pm - +49 171 2317046: For DNN , classical methods wont work good. This was my finding in my master thesis. I would recommend using Bayesian approach for uncertainty estimation
05/04/2022, 2:28 pm - +91 90039 68712: Do you have any documents or links for reference. I am implementing first time.
05/04/2022, 2:29 pm - +91 78755 53730: sharing Transformer Standard Documentation that will give you an idea how to do it....then you can explore and design as per your need
05/04/2022, 2:30 pm - +91 90039 68712: I will look in to Bayesian approach as well.
05/04/2022, 2:30 pm - +91 90039 68712: Ok

05/04/2022, 9:39 pm - +91 87595 25780: Which GPU is suitable for deep learning??
K80
P100
V100
05/04/2022, 9:39 pm - +91 88890 29990: P100
05/04/2022, 9:39 pm - +91 93198 39861: I am using V100 but you don't need it all the time so use P100
05/04/2022, 9:42 pm - +91 6260 831 865: Depends on the need, P100 is enough for training but it trains quite slow, where as V100 is comparatively faster and expensive.
05/04/2022, 9:43 pm - +91 93198 39861: Yes for training V100 can train mask algorithm faster but apart from that you don't need that much computation
05/04/2022, 9:43 pm - +91 87595 25780: We needed for training bert, distiilled bert, Siamese bert etc.
05/04/2022, 9:43 pm - +91 93198 39861: V100
05/04/2022, 9:44 pm - +91 87595 25780: Thanks all for your suggestions.
05/04/2022, 9:44 pm - +91 87595 25780: 👍

I have trained a model with 60 months of data out of 87 months and need to test this on the test data.  However, it needs to be retrained for each month of data and use that for next one month forecasting, then use that for further forecasting and so on.
14/04/2022, 6:31 pm - +91 98102 61701: Therefore, this creates a cumulative forecasting model for the test data.
Anybody know the code/understanding for the same?

22/04/2022, 10:56 am - +91 91317 29237: I have also faced similar problem, but then we tried to train cnn model with an extensive data set of table with border and table without border to detect the rows and columns, then upon getting the bounding box, i have given those boudong box to open cv to crop the image and then passed this cropped image to ocr and then append it to a data frame one by one...
22/04/2022, 10:57 am - +91 91317 29237: However you can also use tabula or tesaract but you need to do lots of data postprocessing according to pattern present in the data

22/04/2022, 10:57 am - +91 97537 99884: Tried that approxh but we need to automate the whole process so that is not working
22/04/2022, 11:00 am - +91 91317 29237: Sorry i dont have any material , but its just a object detection thing with lots of data.... 

Just try to lots of mixure of data and then annotate it properly... 

After that based on your bounding box just crop the image using open cv..

Then simply pass that cropped image to  ocr...

It wont be 100 percent accurate but yes it will be much better than traditional
22/04/2022, 11:01 am - +91 97537 99884: Okay thanks for the suggestion will check on the same

So the scenario is, I have applied to a company and before the interview round i gave them my expected salary figure and now after clearing all the rounds i am not satisfied with my previous expected figure and need to change that.
So please suggest how can i tackle this, tomorrow is my HR round.

Thanks
25/04/2022, 8:53 pm - +91 99130 07097: You can say that,.you have another offer in pipeline which is higher then x so i would need x+2
25/04/2022, 8:55 pm - +91 80958 17985: Maybe if you say this, the company might ask you for the counter offer letter (which in real time you don't have).

Just a thought
25/04/2022, 8:56 pm - +91 99689 05115: Yup, that's an issue. 😌
25/04/2022, 10:35 pm - +91 89206 82464: If you have any old offer letter just change it's date and salary

26/04/2022, 7:15 pm - +91 83280 94226: Hi Krish and Sudhanshu and all,

I had problem related to time series.
As I had 4333 products and for each product I need to have time series .
Like how we can do this?
As of now time series  what i learnt , we have date in one column and sales value/predicted value in other column. and we implement ARIMA or other models.
Multivariate means we include more columns into time series.
But here the problem I had is we have 4333 products at row level and each should be forecasted for future date for 3 different regions ( EAST,WEST, CENTRAL).
So what can be approach or any ideas can help me alot. Thanks everyone in advance.
26/04/2022, 9:44 pm - +91 91124 50344: Pivot the table to bring the products at columns..... Each Column will be a product and each row will be one time unit(date).... And each value will ne the sales value for that date....
26/04/2022, 9:46 pm - +91 91124 50344: Then for each column can be further divvided into 3 column
26/04/2022, 9:46 pm - +91 91124 50344: So i guess number of columns will be 4333*3
26/04/2022, 9:51 pm - +91 91124 50344: It seems like you do not have any other parameters except the sales value so u cannot make it multivariate.... So i guess it will be Univariate for each product and region....
26/04/2022, 10:56 pm - +91 83280 94226: I had 247 varius columns in product level
26/04/2022, 10:57 pm - +91 83280 94226: Where after drilling down....had 60 columns which r considerable in product data

28/04/2022, 11:05 pm - +91 91317 29237: Bro if yiu know answer then simply give it, otherwise dont tell what to do or what not, he simply asked questions and that's why this group is made for.... 

Dont judge people...

He know something thats why he is the part of this group
28/04/2022, 11:08 pm - +91 99536 10772: Yes exactly bro thats correct no one needs to be rude
28/04/2022, 11:08 pm - +91 91317 29237: Giridhar the one liner difference is...

Tfidf is the stats based method which simply store the importance of word in corpous.

Whereas word2vec generates embeddings which also stores the relationship between the words as well.. 

There are also lots of differences which you can check on different blogs..

1. Context (<<Most important factor)
2. Use of Neural networks.
3. Layered or deep architecture.
4. Variations in Vectors produced i.e. ability to produce vectors for the word not present in the training corpus.
5. Speed and complexity of problem its trying to solve.

Need your inputs in below problem statement- In a table, one column consists of where the payment is done (for ex zomato  or some name of restaurant or some petrol pump) and other column is consists of category to which is belongs to (eg Petrol station, Food industry, so on). So I need to create a model  where it would identify the category based on where the payment is done? 
Can you guys pls suggest which model can be best suitable

06/05/2022, 11:12 pm - +91 82855 95360: Interview question:
You used early stopping criterion to avoid over fitting, but your model is at local minima, How will you check that your model is at local minima and what will you do to reach global minima and how will you check your model is at global minima ??

07/05/2022, 1:00 pm - +91 82855 95360: BTW I said we can change learning rate to decide path of gradient and along  with that we can use momentum based optimiser to make gradient to read global minima...But  he was not satisfied.
07/05/2022, 1:00 pm - +91 82855 95360: Learning rate should be low to learn gradient precisely
07/05/2022, 8:53 pm - +91 98993 99757: who wants to participate please do let me know😇😇😇

10/05/2022, 7:44 pm - +91 84475 02454: Hi Guys, we have a bot that gives you links of top news  from few specific news website. Bot is in RPA, now we have to do value addition in that by adding a section of top trending words and declining words. This bot picks links from websites twice in a week. Can anyone provide me few suggestions to achieve this from AI?
10/05/2022, 10:45 pm - +91 91124 50344: Simple approach may be TF-IDF...... From all the news text docs those are present in those links we can get a list of important words after removing stop words.... We can compare it with the last week's top n words with their frequency and calculate the top trending words and declining words
10/05/2022, 11:06 pm - +91 84475 02454: Ok. Thanks
10/05/2022, 11:10 pm - +91 84475 02454: One approach what I think can be with the help of web scrapping, have all data from different links, do data preprocessing, then can go with wordcloud to get the important words.
10/05/2022, 11:11 pm - +91 84475 02454: Can we apply clustering techniques like dbscan on this?
10/05/2022, 11:14 pm - +91 91124 50344: Clustering can be used to group similar news articles together..... I am not sure how that will help here

I have less data set of nutrition. In order to increase the data set size...is SMOGN is the right approach?
I just need to do analysis nothing else
11/05/2022, 8:56 pm - +91 98824 83789: Coz in case of classification we generally use SMOTE. Plz correct me if i am wrong
12/05/2022, 3:16 am - +91 78755 53730: I am facing a wired issue when training BERT Classification. Having a dataset Fever with train test split, on completing training Evaluation score on Test split showed 93% F1 score.
Model weights were saved, afterwards to show the F1 score on the test Split again...loaded the trained BERT Model and calculated the F1 score on the test split which is coming to only 6%....Tried everything but not able to figure out during training it gives good score on test But afterward, it's giving very low scores and to my surprise, if I believe the model is overfit then on train set it should give good F1 score but it is giving very bad F1 score on that too.....so totally confused....I had tried earlier too but this time not getting any clue what's the issue....

If any one has clue plz let me know

12/05/2022, 12:06 pm - +91 97338 41657: Hi Team, Need one help if anyone can help ...

I want to attach feature , after scalling but problem  is after scalling we get numpy array but feature is of dataframe,  how to add that feature in numpy array
12/05/2022, 12:33 pm - +91 90039 68712: It may be very small mistake, check you are mapping the target variable correct? I have faced this issue since I have mapped the target variable values vise versa.
12/05/2022, 12:43 pm - +91 78755 53730: It’s not that was finally able to figure out … I am using huggingface dataset library one particular function I was executing. Now in this function we pass label text in list form. Now will training this list was in particular order and will predicting it order was different. Ideal it shouldn’t affect results as I was passing label2ID but might be internally caused some issue
12/05/2022, 12:43 pm - +91 81490 65804: Try to see the probability of just 1 predictions, if it is getting out correctly. 

The batch may have creating  issue, I faced similar issue in past.
12/05/2022, 1:00 pm - +91 96969 00002: dfscaled = pd.dataframe(data=scaled_array, index= originaldataframe.index,columns=originaldataframe.columns) then add that dataframe feature to this dataframe. And you can convert the whole dataframe to numpy using df.to_numpy()
12/05/2022, 5:00 pm - +91 95662 06221: Guys anyway to rank news articles? Not classification,  rank news articles based on impact
12/05/2022, 5:13 pm - +91 91124 50344: How do we measure the impact..... Like number of views or number of comments?
12/05/2022, 5:58 pm - +91 91124 50344: Any Idea how we can create a one liner(5 to 10 words) headline for any text doc??

19/05/2022, 9:12 am - +91 6386 461 149: Take a look on document similarity task to nlp this you can perform semantic similarity using Bert
19/05/2022, 9:12 am - +91 87780 07517: You can check similarity method that is available in Spacy library
19/05/2022, 9:13 am - +91 95609 67181: Check top2vec model to do topic modeling
19/05/2022, 9:13 am - +91 95609 67181: It's very easy and piwerful
19/05/2022, 9:13 am - +91 95609 67181: Powerful*

19/05/2022, 1:13 pm - +91 91124 50344: If your are using this syntax to create pyspark dataframe then the data has to be in rowtype

20/05/2022, 4:34 pm - +91 98090 37072: Hi, any suggestions on which bank to open a new salary account, HDFC or ICICI ??
20/05/2022, 4:35 pm - +91 78755 53730: Hdfc is best
20/05/2022, 4:36 pm - +91 99010 75959: +1. I recently changed to HDFC and the process was smooth. Took me about 30 mins sitting at home to open the account
20/05/2022, 4:37 pm - +91 98090 37072: Other than easiness to open the account, any benefits?
20/05/2022, 4:39 pm - +91 78755 53730: Easy of doing business which I like the most compare to ICICI
20/05/2022, 4:39 pm - +91 98404 97656: Hey ! If that is just for only for salary account it is the best else I would suggest Icici
20/05/2022, 4:39 pm - +91 98404 97656: +1
20/05/2022, 4:40 pm - +91 99010 75959: There are no special benefits in any bank for salary accounts since some time now.
20/05/2022, 4:41 pm - +91 99010 75959: However, HDFC has an option where your employer has to initiate the corporate account. In that case you get higher interest rates
20/05/2022, 4:41 pm - +91 91317 29237: ICICI will give more offers like discounts, cashback etc as compare to hdfc, however my account is in hdfc 😢
20/05/2022, 4:41 pm - +91 78755 53730: When you take loan then difference if ctc and organisation name is big the rate may differ
20/05/2022, 4:42 pm - +91 99010 75959: Even HDFC claims 2000rs cash back every month but I’m not sure how it works
20/05/2022, 4:42 pm - +91 98404 97656: Small instance this month, I have both the  bank accounts, for cheque deposit of 5 lakhs they asked 25k whereas icici was free.
20/05/2022, 4:42 pm - +91 98404 97656: I have been using Hdfc for past 14years as salary account.
20/05/2022, 4:43 pm - +91 98404 97656: I would suggest Icici rather than Hdfc
20/05/2022, 4:43 pm - +91 99010 75959: This can’t be true. 25k is an exorbitant for making a deposit
20/05/2022, 4:43 pm - +91 99010 75959: Exorbitant amount*
20/05/2022, 4:44 pm - +91 98404 97656: That’s what the point is you can dial cyst care  and conclude that
20/05/2022, 4:44 pm - +91 98404 97656: Cust*
20/05/2022, 4:44 pm - +91 91317 29237: There are lots of discounts on shopping as well if we purchase through icici, while hdfc kuch nahi deta 😢
20/05/2022, 4:44 pm - +91 91317 29237: Here is the main point 😂😅
20/05/2022, 4:45 pm - +91 98404 97656: This instance was just2 weeks back
20/05/2022, 4:45 pm - +91 78755 53730: Use smart buy option from website you get cash back and points too
20/05/2022, 4:46 pm - +91 98090 37072: Did u mean that ICICI is best to use in flipkrt and Amazon?
20/05/2022, 4:49 pm - +91 99010 75959: There’s an RBI rule which says you can’t charge more than 150rs per cheque clearance
20/05/2022, 4:49 pm - +91 99010 75959: All HDFC charges are here:
20/05/2022, 4:49 pm - +91 99010 75959: https://www.hdfcbank.com/personal/save/accounts/savings-account/fees-and-charges
20/05/2022, 4:50 pm - +91 98404 97656: Yes, I did check with my RM But this didn’t apply though.
20/05/2022, 4:51 pm - +91 91317 29237: Its not about buying from website and all bro, a man walks into apple store and he got instant 6k off on any iphone.. 

Whereas there was no discount for me as i am hdfc bank user 😢
20/05/2022, 4:53 pm - +91 99010 75959: Strange
20/05/2022, 4:55 pm - +91 98404 97656: That’s very true brother! This scenario just from recent deposits.
20/05/2022, 4:58 pm - +91 98404 97656: Regarding money deposits in CDM, again ICICI stands out to be the best, 10lakhs limit per day and 200 notes per deposit where Hdfc 2 lakhs per day and 50 notes or 25k
20/05/2022, 4:59 pm - +91 98404 97656: I am not a Fan of Icici or any other bank but it eases out our problem when needed  the most … personal experience

Currently I'm working in an Automotive domain Time Series project. 

In this, the Trend and seasonality is not good. Basically it's increasing and decreasing and I'm unable to come up with a solution. 

Is there any model that I can try if trend and seasonality is not good ? 

I tried with FB prophet and Arima. 

Pls suggest as we struck

23/05/2022, 7:02 pm - +91 82855 95360: You can you Adaptive thresholding operation using openCV library
23/05/2022, 7:03 pm - +91 82855 95360: Thresholding operation will take care of background pixels
23/05/2022, 7:05 pm - +91 82855 95360: If thresholding didn't work then try morphological operation (binary erosion then binary closing)

23/05/2022, 7:15 pm - +91 82855 95360: It will convert your image in two segment, your background will be black or 0 pixel and foreground as 255 means white, means your object will be in white color and background will be in black color. Later you can you perform many operation like dilation or erosion to remove those areas
23/05/2022, 7:23 pm - +91 96201 06750: Okay got it

24/05/2022, 10:43 pm - +91 77240 83836: I believe this que is wrong
24/05/2022, 10:43 pm - +91 77240 83836: You cannot assign *p = &a
24/05/2022, 10:44 pm - +91 77240 83836: Int a - variable
Int *p - pointer 

Since pointer holds the memory location

Right assignment is p = &a
Or 
*P = a
24/05/2022, 10:46 pm - +91 77278 17902: You are right but we can write p = &a 
when we initialize a null pointer
24/05/2022, 10:46 pm - +91 77278 17902: Here I initialize int *p = &a
24/05/2022, 10:46 pm - +91 95662 06221: Guys I have a ocr xml on which I need to do ner
24/05/2022, 10:47 pm - +91 77240 83836: yes here we are assigning wrongly
24/05/2022, 10:47 pm - +91 95662 06221: Should I load xml to pandas
24/05/2022, 10:47 pm - +91 95662 06221: Or ?
24/05/2022, 10:47 pm - +91 77278 17902: No
24/05/2022, 10:47 pm - +91 77240 83836: Right assignment is 
Right assignment is p = &a
Or 
*P = a
24/05/2022, 10:47 pm - +91 77278 17902: You are taking wrong
24/05/2022, 10:47 pm - +91 77240 83836: ye kya h means in which context it is
24/05/2022, 10:48 pm - +91 77240 83836: may be
24/05/2022, 10:48 pm - +91 77278 17902: For this we have to declare int *p =0
24/05/2022, 10:48 pm - +91 77278 17902: Null pointer
24/05/2022, 10:49 pm - +91 77278 17902: Then after we can do p=&a
24/05/2022, 10:49 pm - +91 77240 83836: For this we have to declare int *p =0
is it?
24/05/2022, 10:50 pm - +91 77278 17902: Yes null pointer
24/05/2022, 10:51 pm - +91 77240 83836: ok ok got it
24/05/2022, 10:52 pm - +91 77240 83836: but yes it was nyc ball 😊
24/05/2022, 10:52 pm - +91 95662 06221: This context
24/05/2022, 10:53 pm - +91 77240 83836: please have look into this

25/05/2022, 9:31 am - +91 77240 83836: Hey i made some understanding and i executed as well.


Here l-139 pointer p having the b add and l-140  pointer of pointer q having address of p


So if we are increasing the pointer of p value it increases the the q and referencing the b value indirectly so it does changes in b value as well.....

I have used these to train BERT for regression and classification tasks
31/05/2022, 1:53 pm - +91 99010 75959: You trained the Bert model from scratch right ?
31/05/2022, 1:58 pm - +91 99010 75959: Both instances you recommended are out of budget for us for this project and I’m currently using a g4dn.8xlarge instance for now which does a decent job and fits the company’s pockets Thank you for your inputs.

01/06/2022, 4:02 pm - +91 81429 99226: <Media omitted>
01/06/2022, 4:03 pm - +91 77240 83836: yes it is a shell script
01/06/2022, 4:03 pm - +91 81429 99226: yes its a shell script and have to make a API on top of it
01/06/2022, 4:03 pm - +91 77240 83836: and with that API what are you expecting
01/06/2022, 4:04 pm - +91 81429 99226: automation os user access
01/06/2022, 4:04 pm - +91 81429 99226: from Ui end they will pass parameter and the process is automated for granting access
01/06/2022, 4:05 pm - +91 81429 99226: so first we have to make API and integrate with UI

02/06/2022, 11:24 am - +91 87595 25780: Hi Everyone,
Can I know how generally people save result of different experiment (Training Model) for ML/DL   ?
02/06/2022, 11:26 am - +91 87595 25780: We are working and applied several techniques but not able to track different result and show to management
02/06/2022, 11:27 am - +91 6358 070 852: In my experience,  all the time.
So, that in future we know what worked and what didn't work.
02/06/2022, 11:29 am - +91 87595 25780: But we should show to management and team lead which model we applied and what was the accuracy
02/06/2022, 11:29 am - +91 87595 25780: Like creating report or some kind of graph
02/06/2022, 11:29 am - +91 6358 070 852: Yes, even for that , it's necessary
02/06/2022, 11:29 am - +91 87595 25780: Do you have idea what it should be like or it should include ??
02/06/2022, 11:29 am - +91 6358 070 852: Make doc in which you specify every experiment and its result.
02/06/2022, 11:31 am - +91 6358 070 852: For eg, if your making a conv network, tweak the parameters, for instance, kernel size, dense layer and learning rate, if you tweak that, you may get diff result.
So make a doc and specify after every change, what result you get
02/06/2022, 11:31 am - +91 6358 070 852: And make sure, you change one parameter at one time
02/06/2022, 11:33 am - +91 97412 41188: There is a tool called mlflow for Mlops which serves your requirement

03/06/2022, 12:51 pm - +91 70383 38674: Hi Everyone,

We did a Project of Flipkart Review Extraction. Now, as a 
 advance part I’m trying to do 2 things:

1) Divide a reviews based on topics using NLP.

Take example of Laptop: 
Topic 1 is about performance 
Topic 2 Battery life
Topic 3 anything 
Second part is :
- Generate a brief information about each topics using review comes under that particular topic.
Example: 
What come under performance I want it is in brief summary.

I hope you understand, If anyone have some idea please let me know it will be great help for me. 

Thanks in advance 😊
03/06/2022, 1:51 pm - +91 91317 29237: we have done the same for amazon
03/06/2022, 1:52 pm - +91 91317 29237: but we have extracted the key phrases and then mapping those key phrases with entity like performance, display, camera etc
03/06/2022, 1:53 pm - +91 91317 29237: same thing can be applied here...
03/06/2022, 1:55 pm - +91 91317 29237: get all the reviews, extract the relevant key phrases along with entity, then you can select the entity and its corresponding key phrases... after that you can generate brief summary around those key phrases...
03/06/2022, 1:56 pm - +91 91317 29237: in addition to that you can pass those key phrases to sentiment analyzer so that along with brief summary, you will also have sentiment score, like whether people are liking this entity or not

We need to buy two GPU work station for deep learning projects. Usually we work on NLP projects so according to you kaun sa sahi rahega lena?

Minimum 32Gb GPU ram honi chahiye and...heavy models bhi chal jaye jisme aur optimal rate pe aa jaye.... please do suggest

10/06/2022, 3:37 pm - +91 91317 29237: You can start experimenting using knn

11/06/2022, 12:18 pm - +91 99130 07097: Hi All,

I have to work on new project. Please guide me which steps or approach i should follow.

There is one mobile app, from that app client will take photos of Wine bottle 🍾 or beer 🍺 bottle. I have to read brand name from that photo. 

Can i do OCR in this case?
11/06/2022, 12:19 pm - +46 73 871 91 17: Yes OCR will work
11/06/2022, 12:19 pm - +91 91317 29237: May be you need to detect the label first but in case their is nothing written on bottle except the one you want to extract then you can apply ocr directly
11/06/2022, 12:20 pm - +91 91317 29237: But in case there are too many things present on the bottle and you want to extract relevant information then you can detect the relevant part first, crop it then give it to ocr
11/06/2022, 12:25 pm - +91 99130 07097: Thanks Himanshu

Which are the top 10 product based companies that are working in NLP or related field?
16/06/2022, 10:59 pm - +91 93047 23057: Multiple companies ..

 Even lots of startups are doing lots of RnD in NLP ..

 I had interviewed for 3-4 uk based companies for NLP engineer .
 And finally, got a position in one which is usa based  one
16/06/2022, 11:08 pm - Gaurav Shrivastav: Can you name some of those so that i can prepare and apply there?

16/06/2022, 11:20 pm - +91 93047 23057: But it doesn't seems to prepare for them, 
 Just revise NLP stuffs and apply for all available NLP based positions ..

 In UK, there are multiple startups or mid range companies, they are doing state-of-the-art researches
  So on linked u will get their lists ..

 Plss come in personal, we can talk there ..

22/06/2022, 3:01 pm - +91 99267 31606: well the problem is, in the cell [93] i did it in my own way
but i have usually seen people doing the way like shown in [96]...

The cell 96 is from geeks of geeks

so why people use this complicated way instead of my way, even though the no of lines are same.
Please answer this
22/06/2022, 3:02 pm - +91 99267 31606: @919899399757 sir my doubt is this here....Why many tutorials follow the second code instead of the first code for same task? like complications are higher and no of lines are same so why to use second code?
22/06/2022, 3:03 pm - +91 99267 31606: i will use it but for this particular problem please clear my doubts
22/06/2022, 3:05 pm - +91 91124 50344: We don't use the second method either....We just use np.sum(squares)
22/06/2022, 3:06 pm - +91 91124 50344: np here is import numpy as np
22/06/2022, 3:06 pm - +91 99267 31606: ya may be different people different approach 🤷‍♂️

Has anyone worked on imbalance data? I have tried multiple techniques(up-sampling to SMOTE) to handle the data however; I don't see much improvement in the score.. can anyone help or suggest?
Thanks in advance
23/06/2022, 11:30 am - +91 93198 39861: If up-sampling is not working.You can try to down-sample the majority one or down sample the majority and up sample the minority one
23/06/2022, 11:30 am - +91 81977 00446: Tried this as well
23/06/2022, 11:31 am - +91 81977 00446: Up-sampling, Down sampling, SMOTE, SMOTE ADASYN, SMOTE ENN
23/06/2022, 11:31 am - +91 97903 64120: Some times the data set is biased towards one clause.
23/06/2022, 11:32 am - +91 95662 06221: Give proper class weights that will improve the score

23/06/2022, 11:33 am - +91 81977 00446: How do I verify that can you pls share some link if possible?

23/06/2022, 6:19 pm - +91 95458 24972: Hi , need your inputs guys—problem statement is to convert image to text from pan and Aadhar card .. I am using opencv with tesseract but it is not able to read hindi/marathi languages from it.Can you please help me on that
23/06/2022, 6:26 pm - +91 91760 72251: Use Amazon  ocr
23/06/2022, 6:30 pm - +91 98824 83789: Sir similar task is going on in our department also...team has used LAYOUT LM from hugging face....so what u think is better LayoutLM or Amazon ocr...
23/06/2022, 6:34 pm - +91 91317 29237: I would say, Layoutlm can handle more variation in the data than AMAZON OCR.

You can train your own data set using layoutml, and on top of it you can use layoutml parser ocr by using these marathi and other languages.
23/06/2022, 6:34 pm - +91 91317 29237: However you can download the languages in pytessaract as well  if you want to proceed ahead with this approach only.
23/06/2022, 6:51 pm - +91 98824 83789: Detectron2 also

23/06/2022, 7:44 pm - +91 95458 24972: Thank you sir your inputs
23/06/2022, 7:51 pm - +91 91317 29237: Detectron2 will take only image into consideration for training but if you will see the research paper of Layoutlm then along with image it also consider position of texts in the image which gives it edge over detectron.

Have anyone given interview in Google recently ??
24/06/2022, 3:32 pm - +91 98824 83789: Hi all,
I am deploying on project from git into GKE. There i have docker file which will create a docker image. But during image creation it is showing time out error. In GKE it is like 10min time out and also i dont want to use CLI coz i am doing CICD.

So what could be the solution?

Anything i have to write in docker file?

24/06/2022, 5:16 pm - +91 84475 02454: Hi guys, can anyone suggest what things I can use to parse documents and extract  useful information section wise?
24/06/2022, 5:16 pm - +91 84475 02454: These docs are related to proposals.
24/06/2022, 7:34 pm - +91 91317 29237: Can you elaborate a little bit like what section, and the attributes of the section, such as is every section starts woth some bold headings etc ?
24/06/2022, 11:01 pm - +91 84475 02454: Yes it has specific sections like scope of work, tech spec. These documents don't have specific format as these are proposals from companies that has certain work or problem statements that need to be addressed. These documents are quite bulky and contains 100 of pages. We need to create an extractor that can go through the document and give essential information against each section or module and we have to make sure no important info is missed. This way time taken to go through bulky docs can be saved
25/06/2022, 4:44 pm - +91 84475 02454: Any idea guys?
25/06/2022, 5:06 pm - +91 91317 29237: You can start with detectron then extend the same to layout
25/06/2022, 5:16 pm - +91 84475 02454: sure. Thanks
25/06/2022, 5:19 pm - +91 98824 83789: Anyone?

25/06/2022, 5:28 pm - +91 91317 29237: You have better idea of all the variations in the data, if you have tabular data with in these section then above approach is great but for that also you need to identify each and every section differently. For that you need detectron or layoutml after this you can above mention points

I have a case where i trained a detectron model to identify columns in a table, it gave us good result on training data but for testing it is failing. Looks like overfit problem.

what else i can do to overcome this problem.
01/07/2022, 4:00 pm - +91 91317 29237: I have not included image augmentation, please suggest me if image segmentation can improve this or what else i can try

01/07/2022, 4:06 pm - +91 91317 29237: But it has variations, like it has a table but some has row saperator, some doesnt, some has column some not..
01/07/2022, 4:47 pm - +91 97903 64120: Can yiu please let me know. I am using Bert fot text similarity. Can we find which feature is contributing more. ( Kind of feature importance)

07/07/2022, 1:22 pm - +91 98404 97656: If he or she is interested in getting a certification then they should target some big B schools.
07/07/2022, 1:23 pm - +91 99750 97646: That I totally agree
07/07/2022, 1:23 pm - +91 98404 97656: That would be value add to the individual profile
07/07/2022, 1:23 pm - +91 99750 97646: He's more interested in their advertisement of getting into faang companies 😂
07/07/2022, 1:24 pm - +91 98404 97656: 😂😂😂😂! Then no points Akash … let the individual waste their parent’s money and have fun
07/07/2022, 1:25 pm - +91 91760 72251: 😂😂🤩🤩🤩
07/07/2022, 1:25 pm - +91 98404 97656: Or his / her money
07/07/2022, 1:30 pm - +91 99689 05115: No bro, he has a dream of going into a FAANG and there is nothing wrong.
Instead make him aware that even without spending so much money he can get plenty of knowledge by platforms like Ineuron etc.. and get into FAANG.
07/07/2022, 1:31 pm - +91 99750 97646: That individual belongs to family, his money is also somehow related to our money😂😂
07/07/2022, 1:31 pm - +91 74186 86754: Advertistment !! i asked whats their fees they said its 2.5 L. I was so shocked
07/07/2022, 1:32 pm - +91 98404 97656: 😂😂😂
07/07/2022, 1:32 pm - +91 99750 97646: Yes that is way too much
07/07/2022, 1:32 pm - +91 74186 86754: but he wont get placed in faang companies 🤣
07/07/2022, 1:32 pm - +91 74186 86754: not too much than great lakes
07/07/2022, 1:32 pm - +91 74186 86754: 3.74 lac
07/07/2022, 1:32 pm - +91 74186 86754: more than my engineering fees 🤣
07/07/2022, 1:33 pm - +91 99750 97646: 😂😂😂

07/07/2022, 1:46 pm - +91 91124 50344: I think the sample set of population that you have choosen to get answer on this question is containing bias..... Hence not the results can be skwed😁

07/07/2022, 8:07 pm - +91 98821 90185: Favourite for loop😅
07/07/2022, 8:51 pm - +91 78922 05635: If you are ineuron student then don't go for Scaler. That is waste of money. I joined Appliedaicourse and the same course they provides in scaler. Course wise it is good but now they increase course fee close to 10x. Ineuron is best and affordable then scaler. They created lot of hype by using brand name like  Facebook, Microsoft, Google etc. This is problem with human psychology if someone provides more quality with less price then people will doubt on service.
07/07/2022, 8:56 pm - +91 91760 72251: 🤩🤩🤩🤩

07/07/2022, 9:04 pm - +91 93198 39861: I agree 100%.I have also joined both AppliedAi and Ineuron.AppliedAi course has too much maths but very less hands on practice.Ineuron is best as well as affordable to students.
07/07/2022, 9:06 pm - +91 99750 97646: Totally agree, but it's hard to make few people understand. Even I was student of Dlcvnlp and ml course from ineuron
07/07/2022, 9:33 pm - +91 99945 86598: Yes, we have data science masters, AI OPS, DSA, big data, full stack data science and tons of courses just for 7k 😂😂😂😂👍👍👍😊
07/07/2022, 9:34 pm - +91 99945 86598: After Sudhansu and krish’s classes, I would really data structure classes by priya

07/07/2022, 11:33 pm - +91 99945 86598: Sudhansu ji, online IDE also superb. No need to install tools😂😂😂
07/07/2022, 11:35 pm - +91 99945 86598: It would also be great if all the courses are segregated in right verticals

I rcv a call for data analyst position but they said i will be working on data science work.
So my question is will the position will affect my next switch as a data scientist role or not?
08/07/2022, 5:44 pm - +91 89512 33061: I would suggest do not by position if you having less than 8 years of experience or rather if your into senior or a lead role. Initially until 6 years position doesn't matter as long as you are working in analytics. Hopefully that's clarifies your query, thank you

Could you please suggest me the best cloud instance which I should go for? Please keep in mind that storage files quantity will always increase but not any specific incremental number.

01/08/2022, 12:43 pm - +91 98841 29630: Dear friends,  Good Day. 

I'm working on Time Series Project.  I tried with FBProphet and PyCaret models. 

Now we're asked to work on Azure ML.  For that we  need to know about the Pricing for creating a workspace, python Notebook (jupyter) and compute. 

Can someone please let me know about the Pricing for using Azure ML (monthly) on above ?  

I tried Pricing Calculator. But not sure which instance, category to be selected.
01/08/2022, 1:13 pm - +91 99130 07097: Hi Arun,

First try with compute  instance instead of compute cluster.

Instance family: xxxx_ds_11

Create single workspace, which will provide you all the tools we need for ds experiments.

You will find there compute, datastore, experiments, jobs etc.

I would recommend to read little bit from azure DP 100 exam officials documentation.

Like o/p to be generated as Source audio with target voice
21/08/2022, 6:45 pm - +91 97189 91098: Hi All,

I need some help in solving this problem related to geocoding.

Problem Statement :
You are given, in tab-delimited files,
- the list of PINs with their latitude and longitude. 
Given a PIN, the list of other PINs in the same district are needed.
You can assume that a PIN is in the district to which it is closest by lat-long distance.
You have to use Python for the entire exercise.
The clean and commented code you use for this should be saved as 'YourFullName_Problem1_Code.txt' in the Solution folder. Your output is expected in a tab-delimited file named 'YourFullName_Neighbouring PINs.txt' in the following format in the same folder:

PIN1	[PIN2,PIN8,PIN5]
PIN2	[PIN1,PIN8,PIN5]
PIN3	[]
PIN4	[PIN6,PIN10,PIN11]
21/08/2022, 6:46 pm - +91 97189 91098: Data Looks Like this

Thanks

02/09/2022, 1:35 pm - +91 6386 461 149: https://medium.com/rapids-ai/accelerating-topic-modeling-with-rapids-and-bert-models-be9909eeed2 @16729993979 take a look on this blog it is accelerating the whole infra on Rapids

02/09/2022, 1:46 pm - +1 (672) 999-3979: Thank you @916386461149  Ritesh! I will go through it. Is Rapids better than running jobs on GCP cloud with Nvidia GPU's
02/09/2022, 1:47 pm - +91 99010 75959: I had the same question 😃
I’m currently using AWS cloud with GPU instance
02/09/2022, 2:04 pm - +91 6386 461 149: Yep if you want to accelerate your whole infra on GPU + for faster inference and analysis you can use Rapids because it run much closer to Nvidia CUDA GPU, I have used Cuml and Cudf and they have show faster performance then anyone other framwwork in market.

Using GCP cloud with Nvidia GPU is a viable option for prod app because you can scale up and get high uptime in real time enviorment same for AWS infra.

Cloud solution are majorly best for deploying large solutions including Large language model and Deep Learning model

02/09/2022, 4:15 pm - +91 6386 461 149: I have used only prefer it when you need faster input output operations and loading, I majorly use it for loading data in chunks for faster processing and inference
02/09/2022, 4:16 pm - +91 90803 38368: Large files can be accessed faster
02/09/2022, 4:16 pm - +91 90803 38368: Yeah exactly

05/09/2022, 10:02 am - +91 70157 98146: Damm, i didn't know this, but haven't seen people there or seen few, most of the time i've seen empty office, if possible do pay a visit before indulging anything serious.
05/09/2022, 10:16 am - +91 99130 07097: Yes, they are providing permanent WFH option. So might be ofc is only for hr folks only.

I'm living in Ahmedabad so not possible to visit Bangalore ofc.

Anyways thanks for your msg. I got an offer from this company but not getting feelings to join it 😔

05/09/2022, 5:12 pm - +91 99010 75959: Hello achievers, is there any model which can generate titles based on text ?
05/09/2022, 5:13 pm - +91 78755 53730: Use any text generative transformer based model
05/09/2022, 5:22 pm - +91 91317 29237: You can also make use of topic modeling, which you can use as title. May be bert topic or something like that..

Otherwise you can finetune gpt or any transformer based model
05/09/2022, 5:23 pm - +91 99010 75959: Thank you, will explore more on this.
05/09/2022, 5:26 pm - +91 99010 75959: I’m using bertopic for similar content identification. But it generates titles which don’t make any sense when you read them. I’m looking to generate titles that provide users an idea about what the posts below them contain.
05/09/2022, 5:57 pm - +91 91317 29237: Then you need to finetune gpt or similar model..

05/09/2022, 9:59 pm - +91 95458 24972: You can also try zero shot classification hugging face where you can define your own labels and apply pretrained model over that

Could any pls guide on best resource for voice conversion on gitlab ? 

I have two speakers dataset of 250 audio wav files each that I want to train on,  need model that generates speaker A content with speaker B voice
08/09/2022, 5:19 pm - +91 91317 29237: Cant we do this way..

1) speech to text ->speaker A data, speaker b data.

2) prepare data to finetune GPT or gropher( way better than gpt3)

3) train your model

4) pass the input get the output and convert text to speech

08/09/2022, 5:19 pm - +91 93047 23057: Recently, explored NeuroLab .. 

 Its amazing platform with 123 gigs of memory and a faster processor ..
  Which makes very much efficient for ML based works ..


But will it be equipped with some GPU instances in future .. ??
08/09/2022, 5:20 pm - +91 91317 29237: This is the explanation video for gropher
08/09/2022, 5:26 pm - +91 94936 24803: Thanks for the reply Himanshu,

I tried Real time voice conversion (RTVC) and CoquiTTS which does all these internally, but results were not that good for indian languages
08/09/2022, 5:28 pm - +91 91317 29237: Hmmm may be you need to train or finetune your model explicitly. 

As a result, while testing you can use RTVC with your finetuned model, and definetly results will be far better..

Let me know if i can help you somehow
08/09/2022, 5:28 pm - +91 94936 24803: Sure thanks
08/09/2022, 6:06 pm - +91 6358 070 852: Guys, i need a little help from you'll. 

I was working in a company of around 300 employees,  and i had a bond of 2.5 years.
Because of some family issues, i had to leave the job, and while leaving they gave me 2 months of notice period.
And when i was serving my notice period, in between they deactivate my company credientials.
And now that my notice period is ended, i asked them about my settlement, HR said, you have not worked from office, so you are not eligible.
As a matter of fact, i asked my manager that, i will be doing WFH, and he agreed.
Yet, they are doing this.

Can anyone help me, to sort this out?
08/09/2022, 6:40 pm - +91 95662 06221: Name the company so this does not happen in the future
08/09/2022, 9:01 pm - +91 98824 83789: Hi Akash plz watch this. I randomly saw this reel.

08/09/2022, 9:04 pm - +91 93047 23057: Yes .. it is important, it should not happen with anyone else in future
08/09/2022, 9:05 pm - +91 6358 070 852: I will, but first i want to have my salary for the notice period and then, my experience letter.
I just waiting till tomorrow
08/09/2022, 9:05 pm - +91 6358 070 852: After that, I'll write a mail to COO and CEO
08/09/2022, 9:05 pm - +91 6358 070 852: Thank you for this.
08/09/2022, 9:05 pm - +91 93047 23057: Sometimes they takes months for doing full n final settlement
08/09/2022, 9:06 pm - +91 98824 83789: 👍🏻
08/09/2022, 9:06 pm - +91 93047 23057: But if they are denying, this is the problem ..
08/09/2022, 9:07 pm - +91 6358 070 852: After talking to CEO, I'll take further actions
08/09/2022, 9:07 pm - +91 6358 070 852: But still I'll take it
08/09/2022, 9:07 pm - +91 6358 070 852: Im not going to wait for months, I'll take actions soon.
08/09/2022, 9:09 pm - +91 93047 23057: If they says, they will do, they will definitely do, 
  But if denying, then its a problem ..

  In my case, they have some delay .. i had to wait for delivery of laptop  ..
08/09/2022, 9:12 pm - +91 6358 070 852: I was talking to HR, and HR Denied my settlement. 
Tomorrow, I'm gonna mail my CEO, so that in future, they can't say that, why didn't you go to the higher authority.
08/09/2022, 9:13 pm - +91 6358 070 852: If i do that, without talking to CEO, CEO will be like, you could have come to me.
I want to explore every option then i want to go for anything.
08/09/2022, 9:14 pm - +91 93047 23057: Good luck bro ..
08/09/2022, 9:15 pm - +91 6358 070 852: Going to need some luck😅

Does it reduces inference time.
12/09/2022, 1:43 pm - +91 97903 64120: It's just a keyword search or semantic search ?
12/09/2022, 1:43 pm - +91 97903 64120: If it's semantic search - we could try top2vec
12/09/2022, 1:43 pm - +91 78733 33840: Could anyone suggest good tutorials

12/09/2022, 1:46 pm - +91 90803 38368: not that much i would say around 2 - 2.5x max to max
12/09/2022, 1:47 pm - +91 90803 38368: not very significant on itself but if you combine with some distillation technique then it would be better

In Ner model i have 6 labels. Out of which 2 have less num of counts.   Can we say this is imbalance dataset?
In NER?

15/09/2022, 10:44 pm - +91 87595 25780: Kindly suggest any graph which will suit my problem statement. I am trying plotly express at present
15/09/2022, 10:48 pm - +91 95004 84069: I would love to join the meet-up
15/09/2022, 10:49 pm - +44 7593 952948: You mean , you need display more than 2k products in single graph ?
15/09/2022, 10:49 pm - +91 87595 25780: Yes
15/09/2022, 10:50 pm - +91 87595 25780: For every week, sale of 2k product with quantity
15/09/2022, 10:52 pm - +44 7593 952948: It depends who use the graph and what purpose? 
If someone want to see total products sale per week for past 4 weeks 
Or products selling more or less per week ..

15/09/2022, 10:54 pm - +91 87595 25780: This is what I have tried but it is not clear
15/09/2022, 10:54 pm - +44 7593 952948: More than 2K will be too much for any graph type ..line, bar
15/09/2022, 10:54 pm - +91 87595 25780: Yeah
15/09/2022, 10:54 pm - +91 87595 25780: It's my issue
15/09/2022, 10:54 pm - +91 87595 25780: Any workaround, please suggest
15/09/2022, 10:55 pm - +44 7593 952948: Try converting in to log  May be ..
15/09/2022, 10:55 pm - +91 6386 461 149: Do the same in plotly or in pandas-bokeh
15/09/2022, 10:55 pm - +91 87595 25780: Its plotly only
15/09/2022, 10:56 pm - +91 95662 06221: Guys anyone having knowledge of tableau
15/09/2022, 10:57 pm - +91 95662 06221: I am new to tableau

15/09/2022, 10:57 pm - +91 95662 06221: Pls help
15/09/2022, 10:57 pm - +91 95004 84069: I am a tableau developer
15/09/2022, 10:57 pm - +91 6386 461 149: Then if you want all 4 weeks then I guess it totally depends on data points and time stamp and you need all 4 weeks so this plot is the best one I guess
15/09/2022, 10:58 pm - +91 95004 84069: You can follow the tableau module in iNeuron business analytics course for learning
15/09/2022, 10:58 pm - +91 6386 461 149: The cluster you will be get in every plot because of large data spread
15/09/2022, 10:59 pm - +44 7593 952948: Convert unit values ..
E.g  convert 100 to 0.1 based on your  max and min values per product ..
15/09/2022, 11:01 pm - +91 87595 25780: Sure, thanks guys will try
15/09/2022, 11:02 pm - +44 7593 952948: Or set graph max and min values to  -10k to 10k  to see clear graphs ..play with values
16/09/2022, 8:53 pm - +91 99130 07097: Hi All,

Can  someone please explain p value to explain in interview?

I read it many times but not able to explain to interviewer
17/09/2022, 1:38 am - +91 76760 31474: P-value is the probability value that the null hypothesis is true (if p > 0.05).

If the p-value is low (p < 0.05) then the alternative hypothesis is true.

High p-values indicate that our evidence is not strong enough to suggest an effect exists, so null hypothesis.

Example: 
For P < 0.05

It means that column/dataframe is less significant/importance and we will reject the Null Hypothesis and accept the Alternative Hypothesis.
17/09/2022, 1:43 am - +91 76760 31474: For more details, go through Null & Alternative Hypothesis.

Also, understand the central limit theorem and confidence level (for 5% (0.05) except 95%)
17/09/2022, 8:17 am - +91 99130 07097: Sure, thanks 😊

18/09/2022, 12:40 pm - +91 99856 07339: Exactly it's the old version for decision tree now it's tree.decissiontreeclassifier. tried changing that. 
Infact created new model and pickle file also
18/09/2022, 12:41 pm - +91 77240 83836: Means u got ur answer
18/09/2022, 12:42 pm - +91 99856 07339: Nope... Still showing the same error
18/09/2022, 12:43 pm - +91 77240 83836: Interesting 🤨 then I want to see. As I just did it works for me.
18/09/2022, 12:44 pm - +91 77240 83836: Check ur sklearn version please did it get updated or not
18/09/2022, 12:44 pm - +91 99856 07339: I'm sure, i might have gone somewhere wrong but couldn't find where.

20/09/2022, 11:06 am - +91 93047 23057: Yes me,
20/09/2022, 11:14 am - +91 99010 75959: Work culture and work-life balance is good in Europe. From my understanding tech stack you have to learn is same as in India. When it comes to salary, starting salary will be higher in Europe and annual salary hikes will be low but in india the opposite is true. 
Both have advantages and disadvantages. So you can make a choice depending on what you want. 
Good luck
20/09/2022, 11:17 am - +91 97112 50300: Correct 💯

Currently, Medium doesn't support this facility for India.

21/09/2022, 10:18 pm - +91 93198 39861: I think for mtech specialization in one of the data science fields will be more helpful.
You should search and find the syllabus that interest you more .

22/09/2022, 6:51 pm - +91 97903 64120: Are you using spacy or BERT?

22/09/2022, 6:51 pm - +91 98824 83789: Spacy with Transformer
22/09/2022, 6:51 pm - +91 97903 64120: En core web trf ?
22/09/2022, 6:51 pm - +91 97903 64120: Thanks you sir
22/09/2022, 6:52 pm - +91 98824 83789: Yes but im training with custom data set
22/09/2022, 6:52 pm - +91 97903 64120: Yes I am also training with custom data set, adding new entities
22/09/2022, 6:53 pm - +91 98824 83789: U can use blank spacy entity space and add ur new entities there.
22/09/2022, 6:53 pm - +91 98824 83789: Do not append new entities into that
22/09/2022, 6:53 pm - +91 97903 64120: Evaluation metrics is not showing properly in spacy custom training.😕
22/09/2022, 6:54 pm - +91 97903 64120: 🙁*
22/09/2022, 6:55 pm - +91 97903 64120: And also is there any criteria  ? Like these many sentences should be there for each entity ?( Imbalanced sentence and entity)
22/09/2022, 7:01 pm - +91 98824 83789: See this imbalacing in ner data set query was also came in my mind too. I have searched for it. But i think transformer will take care of that. And i would suggest u also search for it.

But customer don't want to create multiple models ie. One model per field. Because we have 1000s of fields to predict in future, so one model per field is not a scalable solution and difficult to maintain numerous models. So wanted to know if there is any novel way to address this problem? Any leads on this will be helpful to me. Thanks in Advance

02/11/2022, 4:40 pm - +91 98824 83789: Hi,
Do we need to clean data first then do annotation?

I am working with NER project.
02/11/2022, 4:41 pm - +91 93198 39861: Yes
02/11/2022, 4:43 pm - +91 98824 83789: Ok but will there be any semantic mismatch in the meaning. If we clean it, like stop words, full stops, punctuation,etc?
02/11/2022, 4:46 pm - +91 93198 39861: You are right so you have to choose which one to remove or not.

08/11/2022, 3:55 pm - +91 89780 10116: Hi All,
I add one text classification use case where insurance documents should be categorised into 7 different categories which we have already labelled...
08/11/2022, 3:56 pm - +91 89780 10116: Tfidf, word2vec not giving good results...
08/11/2022, 3:56 pm - +91 89780 10116: As most of the documents share similar information...
08/11/2022, 3:57 pm - +91 91317 29237: Is it a pdf document on which you are trying or like a text information
08/11/2022, 3:57 pm - +91 89780 10116: Scanned pdf doc
08/11/2022, 3:57 pm - +91 89780 10116: We are having ocr text of it
08/11/2022, 3:58 pm - +91 91317 29237: In this case i think, keyword extraction will suit more.. and based on the extracted keywords we can decide what type of document it is
08/11/2022, 3:58 pm - +91 89780 10116: We were given specific set of keywords for each category to categories the documents...into their specific category
08/11/2022, 4:00 pm - +91 91317 29237: May be here you can yse direct document only, since along with the text the position of text will also matter like where each and every keyword is appearing.. if both these information will be given to model then i think document can be classified into accurate catagory
08/11/2022, 4:00 pm - +91 91317 29237: Sometime only text is not enough but the location is also important, this is my point of view actually..
08/11/2022, 4:00 pm - +91 89780 10116: All the docs have similar information...for which tfidf,word2vec won't work
08/11/2022, 4:01 pm - +91 91317 29237: You can try layoutlm parser
08/11/2022, 4:01 pm - +91 89780 10116: Ok
08/11/2022, 4:01 pm - +91 89780 10116: Will It work even if documents almost share similar information

23/11/2022, 10:09 pm - +91 96208 98172: There are references to Yolo where u can save file.  That article suggests u how to make small changes and u can use that code. I had found that.... and used it too.
23/11/2022, 10:10 pm - +91 6358 070 852: It has the option there
23/11/2022, 10:10 pm - +91 6358 070 852: In the config file itself
23/11/2022, 10:11 pm - +91 96208 98172: I strongly feel it is yolo5. It has given great results.
23/11/2022, 10:14 pm - +91 96208 98172: U have all the options of ckpt file and other details too.
24/11/2022, 8:20 am - +91 73384 51331: I have checked this and over internet also... Can you please point me to it.. would be of great help

25/11/2022, 2:49 pm - +91 6358 070 852: While you give the command for training in terminal you need to put the path where you need to your checkpoints saved

25/11/2022, 2:54 pm - +91 73384 51331: This will save the latest models not the best models.... For ex if we are training for 100 epochs and the "best model" is in 60th epoch... TFOD saves only for last few epoch ckpt... YOLO on the other hand has parameter to save the 60th ckpt also
25/11/2022, 2:55 pm - +91 73384 51331: So was wondering if TFOD has provision to save the 60th ckpt i.e best ckpt
25/11/2022, 3:05 pm - +91 6358 070 852: No, i don't think
You have to check the performance manually
25/11/2022, 3:06 pm - +91 6358 070 852: If it has this provision, 
Then I'm not aware of it
25/11/2022, 3:06 pm - +91 6358 070 852: But you can convert tye whole ckpt file till 60th epoch or the max epoch to tflite
It will give the beat result

Whenever you are getting the question, measure the question similarity with the assigned topic and also get the similar enities from questions as well as the documents.

This is how you can get the perfect result

08/02/2023, 10:43 pm - +91 91317 29237: In case of tabular data, you can either train and extract using layoutlmv
08/02/2023, 10:43 pm - +91 91317 29237: Not very sure but you can try using tabula and camelot

23/03/2023, 10:02 am - +91 81977 00446: You might enjoy being a data scientist/analyst if you like:

1. Feeling like you have no idea what you’re doing. 
2. Constantly Googling everything. 
3. Banging your head against the wall when your code doesn’t work.
4. Going down deep rabbit holes that don’t lead anywhere. 
5. Constantly having to learn new tools and skills to stay relevant.

It isn’t always glamorous, but for some people, that’s the fun part.💫

05/04/2023, 10:37 pm - +91 91317 29237: Sahil according me to, take this as a challenge buddy, this shift is perfectly okay.. market is not that much stable, however we all are bit safe as compare to other tech stack people but either way you will get to learn.

06/04/2023, 1:41 pm - +91 81490 65804: Is it WFH or Office ? WFH shouldn’t be issue and office too it’s best as other suggested
06/04/2023, 1:46 pm - +91 87882 12771: WFH , just that at such timings , you don't get to go for social events or hang out with friends in the evening,  I know in IT late night work is expected so I don't think I have much choice
06/04/2023, 2:01 pm - +91 99689 05115: Hi guys,
Can anyone point me to some Chemical Engineering related dataset?
I searched a lot but did not find it.
06/04/2023, 2:26 pm - +91 73030 41453: Sahil , you can start discussing about the time frame about the project and may be start a day prior so c the idea once you are working from home it doesn't matter whether u work at day , night, afternoon.so stay ahead of your work by maybe doing work prior to deadlines (like may be work for a weekend) then it's sorted only standups and meetings will stay.A lot of people use this ( u can't argue to change client calls and other aspects rest is sorted)
06/04/2023, 2:32 pm - +91 87882 12771: Yes that will be helpful, actuallyI am fine with attending daily calls, I am just dreaded by the fact that  when my timing are till 10 they can set 9:30 meeting at  9 and you will have to attend that, so there will always be hanging sword till it's 10
06/04/2023, 2:34 pm - +91 73030 41453: Yup that's ok attend calls do work prior to it,tell ur manager u did in time frame 1-10 pm.its fine
10/04/2023, 1:34 pm - +91 99689 05115: Hi there,
I have one question regarding PCA.
Let's suppose I built my model by reducing the features to 15.(orginally 100).
Now, if I want to predict from this model, I can simply convert my new data to PCA(15) and that's it, should work correctly right?
Or Is there any dependency that I need to take care while applying PCA(15) considering the trained data.
10/04/2023, 1:38 pm - +91 73030 41453: It depends on your testing pipeline, consider the case u have simple ui  where the user would pass 100 values that means 1 record (with 100   features) in simple words you have 1 row u can't apply pca on one record so u need more rows ( that means batch testing) then u can apply that pca and use it for testing. Directly applying pca on test data is not recommended in real life since business case is also there.
10/04/2023, 1:40 pm - +91 99689 05115: Let's say I will pass data in batch only then pca(15)  would work right?
10/04/2023, 1:40 pm - +91 73030 41453: Yup

Anyone has idea about how to do addition of LLM embeddings. I have feed new embeddings daily to LLM model along with already generated embeddings.
05/06/2023, 7:51 am - +91 6386 461 149: What kind task youre looking for, you can append the embeddings in a list sequentially.
05/06/2023, 8:31 am - +91 99130 07097: I am developing Question Answer app using Langchain + privateGPT
05/06/2023, 8:34 am - +91 6386 461 149: Then the process is you can add up the embeddings from the new QA pair in a same list every time.

Consider getting embeddings from new data again and again this might help

09/06/2023, 5:27 pm - +91 99130 07097: Hi Guys,

Anyone has an idea about how to implement the below use case:

Need a search/match engine that will search from the database. 
For example: If the user will send the keyword "iPhone with 6.7-inch screen" then from my database I have to do the best match and return results with a confidence score. 

response like:
1. iPhone 14 plus -  confidence score: 91%
1. iPhone 14 pro max -  confidence score: 93%

Can I implement this use case without LLM models?

Thanks in advance
09/06/2023, 5:28 pm - +91 91317 29237: Yes 100 percent, this can be done using langchain + dolly
09/06/2023, 5:28 pm - +91 91317 29237: Or any other llm
09/06/2023, 5:29 pm - +91 91317 29237: Issue with llm is the hallucination problem, you need to deal with this problem, otherwise you will get best result.

I need an opinion from you all.
I have done my btech and is working in Data Science domain itself, but I am considering doing my masters as well in AI.
It's not that I want to do masters for some salary hike or so, it's just that I want to add some weight in my qualifications.

So, what are your thoughts on this?
Should I pursue masters or not?

14/08/2023, 5:14 pm - +91 90803 38368: *DPO paper implementation for making model respond in a way you want to:*
Hi everyone. I recently posted a video on the explanation of the Direct Preference Optimization paper where I had some great responses for it by becoming the first recommendation by google search engine when you search for dpo paper explanation. That was part 1 where the paper was discussed in detail with the comparison with rlhf which it can replace but in a computationally efficient manner.

In this second part of DPO, I have implemented the algorithm to train a model as per my preference. To check if it really aligns the preferences a coding model was taken and was made to generate chat and it provided some impressive results. This if scaled to a great extent it can potentially be one of the top methods to make your model generate responses by your preferences. For this I have used TRL library from HuggingFace to train a model by using DPO. 

If interested to make your model respond in a way you want it to respond check out the following detailed implementation of finetuning and preference optimization of model using DPO in the following video link. Code is provided in the github repo for which the link is available in the description of the video
