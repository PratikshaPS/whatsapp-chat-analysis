I recently posted a video on the explanation of the Direct Preference Optimization paper where I had some great responses for it by becoming the first recommendation by google search engine when you search for dpo paper explanation. That was part 1 where the paper was discussed in detail with the comparison with rlhf which it can replace but in a computationally efficient manner.\n",

      "In this second part of DPO, I have implemented the algorithm to train a model as per my preference. To check if it really aligns the preferences a coding model was taken and was made to generate chat and it provided some impressive results. This if scaled to a great extent it can potentially be one of the top methods to make your model generate responses by your preferences. For this I have used TRL library from HuggingFace to train a model by using DPO. \n",

I recently posted a video on the explanation of the Direct Preference Optimization paper where I had some great responses for it by becoming the first recommendation by google search engine when you search for dpo paper explanation. That was part 1 where the paper was discussed in detail with the comparison with rlhf which it can replace but in a computationally efficient manner.\\n\\nIn this second part of DPO, I have implemented the algorithm to train a model as per my preference. To check if it really aligns the preferences a coding model was taken and was made to generate chat and it provided some impressive results. This if scaled to a great extent it can potentially be one of the top methods to make your model generate responses by your preferences. For this I have used TRL library from HuggingFace to train a model by using DPO. \\n\\nIf interested to make your model respond in a way you want it to respond check out the following detailed implementation of finetuning and preference optimization of model using DPO in the following video link. Code is provided in the github repo for which the link is available in the description of the video\\nVideo Link', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1ji_HlNQ-s\\n']\n",
